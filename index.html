                <h3>Long term goals</h3>
                <p>A long term goal of mine is to get a degree in the field of computer engineering. I want to be able to buy compuer parts and
                uild computers for my family and friends</p>

            <h2>Acomplishments</h2>
                <h3>Educational</h3>
                <p>An education achievement I have achieved is getting accepted into my new school Patino High School. I’m proud of this because
                I feel as I will do really well here. This school focuses a lot of its work around computers, and this is really good for me because
                I love working with computers. I want to be able to do really good things with computers after I graduate college.</p>
                <h3>Personal</h3>
                <p>One of my personal accomplishments that I’ve achieved is reaching Master Guardian Elite within 2 months of playing CS:GO. I want to 
                get to The Global Elite by next year. Getting to Master Guardian Elite is an achievement for me because I really like this video game 
                and it takes a lot of skill and focus. I’d like to say that I’m pretty good at this game and I know how to play this game.</p>
